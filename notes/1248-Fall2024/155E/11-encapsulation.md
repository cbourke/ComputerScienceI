## Encapsulation - Structures
### Fall 2024

* Built-in primitive types (`int, double, char`) are limiting: not everything is a simple number of character
* Real world entities are made up of multiple pieces of data
* In programming languages you can *collect* and **encapsulate** multiple pieces of data together into one logical unit
* In C this is achieved using *structures*
* Structures are "weak" encapsulation
* Encapsulation in general:
  1. The grouping of data
  2. The protection of data
  3. The grouping of functionality that acts on that data
* C is NOT an OOP language and only supports #1 ("weak" encapsulation)

## Defining Structures

* Create a structure that models a *book*
  * ISBN, library of congress ID, etc.
  * Title
  * Author: last name, first name, birthdate, ID (SSN, NUID, tax code, etc.)
  * publish date
