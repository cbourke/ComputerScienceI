## Encapsulation - Structures & Classes
### Fall 2023

* Built-in primitive types `int, double, char` are very limiting: not everything is a number or character
* Real world entities are *composed* of multiple pieces of data
* Encapsulating multiple pieces of data into one "object" or "thing" allows you to deal with that one "thing"
* Solution: encapsulation
  * C: structures
  * Java: Class
* Encapsulation is a mechanism that allows you to:
  1. Group pieces of data together to form one logical "unit"
  2. Protect that data from the outside world/code
  3. Group functionality that acts on that data with the data
* Java: supports all three, it has *strong* encapsulation (because it is an OOP = Object-Oriented Programming language)
* C: weak encapsulation, it only supports #1
