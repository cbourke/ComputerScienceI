## Functions & Methods
### Fall 2023

* A *function* is a reusable unit of code that may take input(s) and may produce an output
* Often referred to as a "unit" when doing unit testing
* In Java: they are called "methods"
* Already familiar with functions: `main(), printf(), sqrt()`, etc.
* Familiar with functions from math: $f(x) = x^2$
  * Input: $x$
  * Output: $y = x^2$
  * You can also have multivariate functions: $f(x, y)$, $f(x, y, z)$, $f()$
* Functions facilitate code reuse: you don't have to copy-pasta chunks of code; instead you put them into a function and then *call* or *invoke* the function
* DRY Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself!
* Procedural Abstraction:
  * How does `sin()` work?
  * Taylor series, numerical interpolation methods,
  * Who cares?  We simply want to *use* that functionality and not have to worry or think about how it gets done
* By *encapsulating* functionality into functions, then we don't have to think about the details
* Standard libraries and external libraries come with a LOT of testing, debugging and optimization that you *cannot* hope to replicate!
* IE: "don't reinvent the wheel", "don't roll your own"
* Problem solving: when asked to solve a problem, what is the first question you should ask?
  * Does a solution already exist?
  * OR: does an "off the shelf" solution exist that can be *adapted*

## Functions in C

* As with variables, functions must be declared before you can use them
* In C you "declare" a function using a *prototype*
* A prototype declares a function's *signature*
  * Its identifier: its name
  * The type of variable it returns and
  * Any parameter types (inputs or arguments) it takes
* In general, every function should have doc-style documentation which is associated with the prototype
* DRY Principle = Don't Repeat Yourself

Observations:
* The prototype has no function "body": it ends with a semicolon
* Convention: use `lowerCamelCasing` for function names, and in general we use *verbs*
* Later on in your program, you *then* define what the function does by providing a function *definition*: repeat the prototype but instead of a semicolon you provide a function *body*
* The code in the function body is what is executed when you *call* or *invoke* the function
* Control flow is "handed over" to the function and it computes until it gets to a `return` statement...
* At which point control is given *back* to the calling function
* Any variables declared inside a function are *local* to that function and they have *local scope* to that function
