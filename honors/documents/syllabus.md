> "If you really want to understand something, the best way is to try
> and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your
> own mind... that's really the essence of programming. By the time
> you've sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a
> stupid machine can deal with, you've certainly learned something about
> it yourself."
>
> —Douglas Adams, *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency*

> In my experience, you assert control over a computer–show it who's the
> boss–by making it do something unique. That means programming it... If
> you devote a couple of hours to programming a new machine, you'll feel
> better about it ever afterwards"
>
> —Michael Crichton, Electronic Life

> The readings were the most underrated things ever (I've never actually
> read them but I wish I did) thanks for providing them and leaving the
> whole course available to us.

>
> -Bjarne Stroustrup (creator of C++)

> But be aware that you won't reach the skill level of a hacker or
> even merely a programmer if you only know one language--you need to
> learn how to think about programming problems in a general way,
> independent of any one language.  To be a real hacker, you need to
> have gotten to the point where you can learn a new language in days
> by relating what's in the manual to what you already know.  This
> means you should learn several very different languages.
>
> -Eric S. Raymond, How to Become a Hacker (The Cathedral and the Bazaar)

> I came into this class able to code by constantly using references
> and needing to double check my code. I left as a coding machine. The
> rate at which I did the last homework was like that of whole other
> person.

you should be able to exhibit.

-   You should have a mastery of the fundamentals of programming in a
    high-level language, including data types and rudimentary data
    structures, control flow, repetition, selection, input/output, and
    procedures and functions.

-   You should be able to approach a reasonably complex problem, design
    a top-down solution, and code a program in a high-level programming
    language that automates solutions.

-   You should have a familiarity with problem solving methods,
    including problem analysis, requirements and specifications, design,
    decomposition and step-wise refinement, and algorithm development
    (including recursion).

-   You should have a familiarity with software development principles
    and practices, including data and operation abstraction,
    encapsulation, modularity, code and artifact reuse, prototyping,
    iterative development, best practices in coding design, style, and

    short amount of time.

## Schedule

See the course website.

## University Services

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide
flexible and individualized accommodations to students with documented
disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in
course activities or to meet course requirements. To receive
accommodation services, students must be registered with the Services
for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 232 Canfield
Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY.

### Counseling and Psychological Services

UNL offers a variety of options to students to aid them in dealing with
stress and adversity. [Counseling and Psychological Services](https://caps.unl.edu/)
(CAPS) is a multidisciplinary team of psychologists and counselors that works
collaboratively with Nebraska students to help them explore their
feelings and thoughts and learn helpful ways to improve their mental,
psychological and emotional well-being when issues arise. CAPS can be
reached by calling 402-472-7450. Big Red Resilience & Well-Being
provides fun events, innovative education, and dynamic services to help
students understand emotions, manage stress, build strength, connect
with others, develop grit and navigate transitions.

## Grading

Assessment (grading) will be based on labs, "hacks", a
semester project and two exams with the following point distributions.

|  Category           | Number | Points Each | Total |
|  -------------------|--------|-------------|-------|
|  Skills Survey      |        |            1|     40|
|  Labs               |      14|           15|    210|
|  Hacks              |      28|           25|    700|
|  Project            |       2|           75|    150|
|  Midterm            |       1|          100|    100|
|  Final              |       1|          100|    100|
|  Total              |        |             |  1,300|

### Skills Survey

The CSE Skills Inventory Survey involves two short surveys
administered through an external website.  We administer
this survey in order to collect data to better place students
into future Computer Science courses.  These surveys are
required and are worth 40 points total.  Please take the
survey seriously and answer truthfully.  You are not being
graded on your answers, only that you complete the surveys.  
Both surveys should take less than 1 hour to complete.

<!--
It is important to start out positively. Put yourself in the mindset
that you *will* succeed in this course and commit yourself to putting in
a full effort in every aspect of it. To get you started, we're giving
you **free starter points**. You have a perfect score in this course already!
Keep it up!
-->

### Attendance Policies

Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, physical attendance at lecture,
labs, and hacks is not required.  We will continue to deliver this course
in a "hybrid" manner:

-  All lectures are livestreamed and recordings are available immediately after.
   A live Q&A through Piazza is available during lecture as well.  

-  All lab and hack sessions as well as office hours will have Learning
   Assistants available both in-person and online via zoom.

-  There is a 100% online section for this course (main section only) as an
   alternative.  

#### COVID Considerations


Out of respect for faculty and staff, out of respect for the Learning Assistants,
and out of respect for your fellow students and most especially yourself, you
should make sure you are fully vaccinated if you plan to attend lecture, lab,
and hack sessions in person.  Several vaccines are widely available, highly
effective and backed by sound science.  The good majority of adults have
been vaccinated and you should be one of them.  UNL has provided
opportunities to receive a vaccine (free of charge); please consider doing this
as soon as possible.  More information can be found here:
https://covid19.unl.edu/vaccination-information.

Everyone is required and expected to follow all health and safety
guidelines published by the CDC, healthcare officials and the
University of Nebraska--Lincoln.  If you are not fully vaccinated and
still decide to attend in-person lecture, lab or hack sessions,
you will be ***required*** to wear a mask.  If you are fully
vaccinated, you are still **strongly recommended** to wear a mask
given the limited social distancing and disappointingly low
vaccination rates among college age groups in Nebraska.  

If you feel ill or have had exposure to COVID-19, you
**should not attend in-person** and instead utilize the online
opportunities we have provided.  Those who violate the testing
policies or receive a positive test may not be granted access to
University buildings and so you may need to attend remotely.  Getting
vaccinated as soon as you can greatly improves not only your health
risks but also greatly reduces the chance that your access will be
restricted.  

Full expectations and consequences are outlined here:

 - https://studentconduct.unl.edu/covid-19-related-expectations-and-non-compliance

 - https://covid19.unl.edu/face-covering-policy


### Labs

There will be weekly labs that give you hands-on exercises for topics
recently covered in lecture. The purpose of lab is not only to give you
further working experience with lecture topics, but also to provide you
with additional information and details not necessarily covered in
lecture. Each lab will have some programming requirements and a
supplemental worksheet.

Depending on logistics, those in the on-campus section may be randomly
paired with a partner. One of you will be the *driver* and the other
will be the *navigator*. The navigator will be responsible for reading
the instructions and guiding the driver. The driver will be in charge of
the keyboard and will type the code. Both driver and navigator are
responsible for developing and working through solutions together.
Neither the navigator nor the driver is "in charge," it is an equal
partnership. Beyond your immediate pairing, you are encouraged to help
and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

For those in the online section or those attending remotely, you may
work alone or we may partner you with someone in a zoom breakout room.

Each lab is assessed based on completion. In general you will need to
submit code and an electronic writeup of your worksheet (plain text or
markdown is preferred) through webhandin which can also be verified
using the webgrader. You will have until midnight on the day of the lab
(Tuesdays) to submit your solutions. Points will be awarded based on the
results of the webgrader.

### Hacks

There will be weekly Thursday *hack sessions* that will provide an
opportunity to start working on exercises in an open, collaborative
environment. Each hack session is a simple program or exercise. You may
not necessarily complete the entire exercise during the hack session,
but it is due by 23:59:59 the following Monday.

Further details are provided in the handouts, but you are highly
encouraged to collaborate with any individual and to receive as much
help as you desire on the exercises.

### Project

There is an end-of-semester programming project due on the Friday of
"dead week." This project must be completed individually by each student
and no collaboration is allowed. You may consult with each other at a
*high level* but may not share or view other student code.

### Exams

There will be one midterm exam and a comprehensive final exam. These
will be open-book, open-note, *required computer* exams. The exams
consist of live coding exercises for which you will need your own
machine as you will be coding and submitting programs online for
grading. More details will be announced closer to the exam dates.
No collaboration is allowed on exams.

### 15th Week Policy Notification

A per UNL's 15th Week Policy (also known as "dead week") available here:

<https://registrar.unl.edu/academic-standards/policies/fifteenth-week-policy/>

we are required to serve written notice that the final assignment as
well as the final lab, hack, and assignment will be due during the 15th
week.

### Scale

Final letter grades will be awarded based on the following standard
scale. This scale may be adjusted upwards if the instructor deems it
necessary based on the final grades only. No scale will be made for
individual assignments or exams.

| Letter Grade | Percent |
|--------------|---------|
| A+           | >= 97%  |
| A            | >= 93%  |
| A-           | >= 90%  |
| B+           | >= 87%  |
| B            | >= 83%  |
| B-           | >= 80%  |
| C+           | >= 77%  |
| C            | >= 73%  |
| C-           | >= 70%  |
| D+           | >= 67%  |
| D            | >= 63%  |
| D-           | >= 60%  |
| F            | < 60%   |

### Grading Policy

If you have questions about grading or believe that points were deducted
unfairly, you must first address the issue with the individual who
graded it to see if it can be resolved. Such questions should be made
within a reasonable amount of time after the graded assignment has been
returned. No further consideration will be given to any assignment a
week after it grades have been posted. It is important to emphasize that
the goal of grading is consistency. A grade on any given assignment,
even if it is low for the entire class, should not matter that much.
Rather, students who do comparable work should receive comparable grades
(see the subsection on the scale used for this course).

### Late Work Policy

In general, there will be no make-up exams or late work accepted.
Exceptions may be made in certain circumstances such as health or
emergency, but you must make every effort to get prior permission.
Documentation may also be required.

Homework assignments have a strict due date/time as defined by the CSE
server's system clock. All program files must be handed in using CSE's
webhandin as specified in individual assignment handouts. Programs that
are even a few seconds past the due date/time will be considered late
and you will be locked out of handing anything in after that time.

### Webgrader Policy

Failure to adhere to the requirements of an assignment in such a manner
that makes it impossible to grade your program via the webgrader means
that a disproportionate amount of time would be spent evaluating your
assignment. For this reason, we will not grade any assignment that does
not compile and run through the webgrader.

## Honors Section

This is the honors section of our main Computer Science I course
(CSCE 155E).  We cover the same topics but at accelerated pace
and there are higher expectations.  In particular, we cover ***two***
programming languages in parallel (typically C and Java) and
most assignments will require knowledge of both.  

The key differences between the honors section and the main section
include:

-  We do *not* use zyBooks (an online interactive textbook with
   graded readings).  Instead, you will be expected to keep up
   with recommended reading as necessary to learn/reinforce the
   material on your own.  The recommended reading for this course
   is taken from my free online Computer Science I textbook so
   there is nothing additional to purchase.

-  Each weekly lab has both a C and Java version.  You are ***highly
   recommended*** to complete both but only *one version* needs to be
   submitted for credit.

-  Each weekly hack has both a C and Java version.  You are ***required***
   to submit both of them for credit.

-  In addition, though you have a scheduled lab section each week,
   there is no additional *scheduled* hack session.

-  The semester project has both a C and Java version.  You are ***required***
   to submit both of them for credit.

-  Exams will have a mixture of C and Java exercises.  

## Academic Integrity

All homework assignments, programs, and exams must represent your own
work unless otherwise stated. No collaboration with fellow students,
past or current, is allowed unless otherwise permitted on specific
assignments or problems. The Department of Computer Science &
Engineering has an Academic Integrity Policy. All students enrolled in
any computer science course are bound by this policy. You are expected
to read, understand, and follow this policy. Violations will be dealt
with on a case by case basis and may result in a failing assignment or a
failing grade for the course itself. The most recent version of the
Academic Integrity Policy can be found at
<http://cse.unl.edu/academic-integrity>

## Communication & Getting Help

The primary means of communication for this course is Piazza, an online
forum system designed for college courses. We have established a Piazza
group for this course and you should have received an invitation to
join. If you have not, contact the instructor immediately. With Piazza
you can ask questions anonymously, remain anonymous to your classmates,
or choose to be identified. Using this open forum system the entire
class benefits from the instructor and TA responses. In addition, you
and other students can also answer each other's questions (again you may
choose to remain anonymous or identify yourself to the instructors or
everyone). You may still email the instructor or TAs, but more than
likely you will be redirected to Piazza for help.

In addition, there are two anonymous suggestion boxes that you may use
to voice your concerns about any problems in the course if you do not
wish to be identified. My personal box is available on the course
webpage. The department also maintains an anonymous suggestion box
available at <https://cse.unl.edu/contact-form>.

### Learning Assistant Program (LAP)

This course is supported by the CSE Learning Assistant Program (LAP).  
The mission of the LAP is to improve student comprehension and
retention in computing fields by focusing on the learner's experience.
This course will be supplemented by Learning Assistants (LAs) and Course
Leaders (CLs) to help improve your learning. LAs and CLs are other
undergraduate students who have taken the same or similar courses
and have been trained to help you succeed in this course. Your LAs
and CLs will hold regular office hours, help with grading, and assist
you with labs/assignments.

I strongly encourage you to utilize the LAs and CLs when you are
completing coursework. More information can be found in the Learning
Assistant Program Module on Canvas.

### Getting Help

Your success in this course is ultimately your responsibility. Your
success in this course depends on how well you utilize the opportunities
and resources that we provide. There are numerous outlets for learning
the material and getting help in this course:

-   Lectures: attend lectures regularly and when you do use the time
    appropriately. Do not distract yourself with social media or other
    time wasters. Actively take notes (electronic or hand written). It
    is well-documented that good note taking directly leads to
    understanding and retention of concepts.

-   Lecture Videos: Lecture videos are intended as a supplement that
    mirrors lecture material but that may not cover everything. Watch
    them at your own pace on a regular basis for reiteration or in case
    you missed something in lecture.

-   Required Reading: do the required reading on a regular basis. The
    readings provide additional details and depth that you may not
    necessarily get directly in lecture.

-   Labs & Hack Sessions: use your time during lab and hack sessions
    wisely. Engage with your lab instructors, teaching assistants, your
    partner(s) and other students. Be sure to adequately prepare for
    labs by reading the handouts before coming to lab. Get started and
    don't get distracted.

-   Piazza: if you have questions ask them on Piazza. It is the best and
    likely fastest way to get help with your questions. Also, be sure to
    read other student's posts and questions and feel free to answer
    yourself!

-   Office Hours & Student Resource Center: the instructor and teaching
    assistants hold regular office hours throughout the week as posted
    on the course website. Attend office hours if you have questions or
    want to review material. The Student Resource Center (SRC,
    <http://cse.unl.edu/src>) Monday through Friday. Even if your TAs
    are not scheduled during that time, there are plenty of other TAs
    and students present that may be able to help. And, you may be able
    to help others!

-   Don't procrastinate. The biggest reason students fail this course is
    because they do not give themselves enough opportunities to learn
    the material. Don't wait to the last minute to start your
    assignments. Many people wait to the last minute and flood the TAs
    and SRC, making it difficult to get help as the due date approaches.
    Don't underestimate how much time your assignment(s) will take and
    don't wait to the week before hand to get started. Ideally, you
    should be working on the problems as we are covering them.

-   Get help in the *right way*: when you go to the instructor or TA for
    help, you must demonstrate that you have put forth a good faith
    effort toward understanding the material. Asking questions that
    clearly indicate you have failed to read the required material, have
    not been attending lecture, etc. is *not acceptable*. Don't ask
    generic questions like "I'm lost, I don't know what I'm doing".
    Instead, explain what you have tried so far. Explain why you think
    what you have tried doesn't seem to be working. Then the TA will
    have an easier time to help you identify misconceptions or problems.
    This is known as "Rubber Duck Debugging" where in if you try to
    explain a problem to someone (or, lacking a live person, a rubber
    duck), then you can usually identify the problem yourself. Or, at
    the very least, get some insight as to what might be wrong.
