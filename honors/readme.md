# Computer Science I - Honors
**[Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.unl.edu)**  
**[University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://unl.edu)**

This repository hosts documents, files, and other artifacts
related to Computer Science I.  This subdirectory hosts files
related to the honors section, (offered as CSCE 155H).

The honors section of this course covers the same basic topics as
the main section, but we cover two languages (C and Java) in parallel.

## Videos

We have produced over 50 lecture and tutorial videos that should
be viewed prior to lecture and which are available in the following
playlist.  Note that these pre-prepared video lectures only cover
C at this time.
