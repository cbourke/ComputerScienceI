# Introduction

Hack session activities are small weekly programming assignments
intended to get you started on full programming assignments. You may
complete the hack on your own, but you are *highly encouraged* to work
with another student and form a hack pair. Groups larger than 2 are not
allowed. However, you may discuss the problems *at a high level* with
other students or groups. You may not share code directly outside your
pair.

If you choose to form a Hack Pair, you *must*:

1.  Both join a hack pair on Canvas (go to People then Groups)

2.  You must both work on the hack equally; it must be an equal effort
    by both partners. Do not undermine your partner's learning
    opportunity and do not undermine your own by allowing one parter to
    do all the work.

3.  Both of you should hand in a copy of your code, but we'll grade the
    code under the individual whose last name comes first alphabetically.

## Rubric

You are graded based on style, documentation, design and correctness.
For detail, see the general course rubric.

| Category      | Points |
|---------------|--------|
| Style         | 2      |
| Documentation | 2      |
| Design        | 5      |
| Correctness   | 16     |
| Total         | 25     |

Correctness: 3 points for each major error (1 additional minor error = 1
pt)

# Problem Statement

Debugging is an essential skill for any software developer. The novice
approach of using debug print statements is inefficient, error-prone,
and unreliable in general. Real debugging requires a more sophisticated
tool called (surprisingly) a *debugger*. In this hack, we'll introduce
you to the basic usage of GDB, GNU's Debugger tool.

Starter code for this hack can be found in the following repository:

<https://github.com/cbourke/CSCE155-Hack9.0>

# Basic Walkthrough

We've provided a small program (see `arrayDebug.c`) that randomly
generates an array of integers and computes their average. However, the
program contains several bugs. Follow the instructions below to use GDB
to inspect this program and find and fix these bugs. To do this hack,
you'll need to work on CSE or have GDB installed on your own computer.

### Bug, The First

1.  To get started, we'll need to compile the program specifically for
    GDB by using the `-g` flag:

    `gcc -g arrayDebug.c`

    Using this flag means that GDB will preserve function and variable
    names and line numbers for the debugger. Normally this information
    is not retained in a compiled program. *Note*: if you use the
    `-Wall` flag, you may want to omit it in this walkthrough to
    avoid spoilers.

2.  Take a quick look at the code to get an idea of what the program is
    trying to compute, but do not change anything yet. Try running the
    program; it takes 1 command line argument: an integer representing
    the size of the random array you want to generate. You'll want to
    keep it small, say:

    `./a.out 5`

    You'll see that the program crashes with a segmentation fault. There
    is little information to go on, so we'll need to fire up a debugger
    and see what's going on.

3.  To start the GNU debugger running your program with command line
    arguments you can use:

    `gdb --args a.out 5`

    Alternatively, you can start GDB without args using
    `gdb a.out` and once it has started, you can set (and reset)
    the argument(s) using `set args 10`

4.  Once GDB has started, you'll be in an interactive "shell" in which
    you can give GDB (and your program) commands. Start by having GDB
    run your program by typing:

    `run`

    which will run your program and *pause* its execution when it gets
    to the segmentation fault.

5.  GDB will display the line of code at which the error occurred.
    However, it will be more helpful to see the entire source file. To
    do this use the Text User Interface (TUI) mode by typing:

    `layout next`

    Using the up and down arrows, you can scroll through the source
    file. Occasionally, the display may glitch. Don't panic, simply
    type:

    `refresh`

    and the screen will refresh itself. As a short-cut you can use
    control-L to refresh.

6.  Examine some of the variable values to investigation what the issue
    is. To print a variable value, use:

    `print i`

    `print n`

    To print the contents of an array, you need to dereference it and
    provide GDB with its length. Example:

    `print *a@5`

    In this particular case GDB will be unable to print the contents of
    the array. Obviously something went wrong before the program got to
    this point.

7.  To find out what went wrong with the array, we need to rerun the
    program and examine its execution *before* we got to the
    segmentation fault. To do this, set a *breakpoint* in the program. A
    breakpoint is a line or point in a program where the debugger will
    pause execution from which you can continue execution in a
    step-by-step manner. Set a breakpoint at the `randomArray`
    function where the array was created:

    `break randomArray`

    Restart the program by typing `run` and confirming.

8.  GDB will pause execution at the beginning of the `randomArray`
    function. You can now step through the program line by line by
    typing `next` or just simply `n`. Note that if you
    want to resume execution, you can use the `continue` command.

    1.  Step through an iteration of the for loop and print the array:
        `print *a@5`

    2.  Step through the second iteration and print it again:
        `print *a@5`

    3.  This can get tedious, so you can set a watchpoint that will
        print a variable any time it changes. Set a watch point for the
        array: `watch *a@5`

    4.  Step through the rest of the iterations and watch the array get
        filled with random values.

    5.  Step through the return of the function; when it gets back to
        the `main` function, print the contents of the array again:
        `print *arr@5` and you'll see that you cannot access the
        memory there.

9.  Quit out of GDB using `quit` and edit the code to fix this
    bug (hint: what did the `randomArray` return?) and recompile.

### Bug, The Sequel

1.  Run the program again from the command line to see if it works. It
    should run but it probably won't give correct results (on some runs
    it may, but on most it will not). Start GDB again but this time use
    the following to immediately start it in TUI

    `gdb -tui --args a.out 5`

2.  The problem probably lies with how we're computing the average, so
    set a breakpoint either at the start of the `average` function:

    `break average`

    or at a particular line within that function, example:

    `break 54`

3.  Set another break point at the end of the function:

    `break 58`

    Note that you can set a breakpoint at a particular line in any file
    using the syntax:

    `break fileName.c:42`

4.  Now, you can either step through the execution of the loop and/or
    set a watchpoint on the `sum` variable or you can skip ahead to
    the end of the loop by using `continue` which will resume
    execution until the next breakpoint.

5.  Print the `sum` variable's value to see if it matches the value
    you expect. Or:

    -   You can print all local variables using

        `info locals`

    -   You can print all the parameter values using

        `info args`

    -   You can print the value of expressions as well, example:

        `print sum / n`

    -   Since return values are not stored in variables, another thing
        you can do is to use

        `finish`

        which will continue execution until the function returns and
        then prints the returned value.

6.  Fix the bug(s) that you were able to identify and recompile/rerun
    the program until you are certain that all bugs have been addressed.

## The Main Show

Now that you have some familiarity with GDB, you'll use your new
debugging skills to debug a full program. We have provided source files
and a makefile that builds a tic-tac-toe game project. The game allows a
player to select several different modes including a 2-player game, a
1-player versus the computer (which makes random moves) and a 1-player
versus a "smart" computer.

Similar to the previous part, we have introduced several bugs (6 to be
exact). Run the program and use GDB to walk through section(s) of the
code you believe to contain bugs and fix them all until the program runs
without any problems.

Some tips/hints:

-   Write down the sequence of inputs/moves that led to a crash/bug so
    that you can *reproduce* the sequence when debugging and so that you
    can retest the sequence when you think you've fixed the bug.

-   When you observe a bug, describe exactly how it manifests, this will
    help you form a *hypothesis*

-   Set breakpoints and watchpoints so that you can trace through the
    program to points where you believe bugs might be located.

-   Try to fix only one problem at a time and keep track of your fixes.
    In a real project you would do so through a bug tracking system and
    commit messages, but for this hack you may do so through comments.

-   Keep in mind that bugs may manifest themselves later in the program
    when the problem lies earlier in the program.

-   You can get a bigger picture in GDB by printing out a full stack
    trace using

    `backtrace full`
