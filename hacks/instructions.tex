\section*{Introduction}

Hack session activities are small weekly programming assignments intended
to get you started on full programming assignments.  Collaboration is allowed
and, in fact, \emph{highly encouraged}.  You may start on the activity before
your hack session, but during the hack session you must either be actively 
working on this activity or \emph{helping others} work on the activity.
You are graded using the same rubric as assignments so documentation, style, 
design and correctness are all important.  This activity is due at 23:59:59
on the Monday following the hack session in which it is assigned according
to the CSE system clock.
