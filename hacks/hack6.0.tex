Correctness:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 6 points for the cmocka tests: you must pass all and there 
  should be at least 23 total; cmocka must be used, no custom testing
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 2 points for our tests
    \item 4 points for their tests (-4 if they didn't include any originals)
  \end{itemize}
  \item 2 points each for Beta-1 and Beta-2
  \item 6 points for the big randomized test cases below that
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem Statement}

In this hack you'll get some more practice writing functions that utilize 
pass-by-reference (pointers), error handling and enumerated types.  There 
are several different
ways to model colors including RGB and CMYK.  RGB is generally used in displays
and models a color with three values in the range $[0, 255]$ corresponding to 
the red, green and blue ``contribution'' to the color.  For example, the
triple $(255, 255, 0)$ corresponds to a full red and green (additive) value
which results in yellow.  CMYK or Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black is a model used
in printing where four colors of ink are combined to make various colors.
In this system, the four values are on the scale $[0, 1]$.  Write 
functions to convert between these models.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a function to convert from an RGB color model to CMYK.  To 
convert to CMYK, you first need to scale each integer value to the range 
$[0, 1]$ by simply computing
	$$r' = \frac{r}{255}, \quad g' = \frac{g}{255}, \quad b' = \frac{b}{255}$$
	and then using the following formulas:
\begin{align*}
k & = 1-\max\{r', g', b'\} \\
c & = \frac{(1-r'-k)}{(1-k)} \\
m & = \frac{(1-g'-k)}{(1-k)} \\
y & = \frac{(1-b'-k)}{(1-k)} \\
\end{align*}
Your function should have the following signature:

\mintinline{c}{int rgbToCMYK(int r, int g, int b, double *c, double *m, double *y, double *k)}

Identify any and all error conditions and use the return value to indicate
an error code (0 for no error, non-zero value(s) for error conditions).  Note
that one edge case is black, when $(r,g,b) = (0,0,0)$ which would lead to a 
division by zero in the formulas.  The equivalent CMYK values are $(0,0,0,1)$.


\item Write a function to convert from CMYK to RGB using the following formulas.
\begin{align*}
r & = 255 \cdot (1 - c) \cdot (1-k) \\
g & = 255 \cdot (1 - m) \cdot (1-k) \\
b & = 255 \cdot (1 - y) \cdot (1-k) \\
\end{align*}
Results should be rounded.  Your function should have the following signature:

\mintinline{c}{int cmykToRGB(double c, double m, double y, double k, int *r, int *g, int *b)}

Identify any and all error conditions and use the return value to indicate
an error code (0 for no error, non-zero value(s) for error conditions).

\end{enumerate}



\section*{Instructions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item You are encouraged to collaborate any number of students 
  before, during, and after your scheduled hack session.  
  \item Design at least 3 test cases for each function
  \emph{before} you begin
  designing or implementing your program.  Test cases are 
  input-output pairs that are known to be correct using means
  other than your program.
  \item You may (in fact are encouraged) to define any additional
  ``helper'' functions that you find useful.
  \item Include the name(s) of everyone who worked together on
  this activity in your source file's header.
  \item Place your prototypes and documentation in a header file 
  named \mintinline{text}{colorUtils.h} and your source in a file
  named \mintinline{text}{colorUtils.c}.
  
  \item A testing file, \mintinline{text}{utilsTester.c} has been 
  provided that uses cmocka (\url{https://cmocka.org/}), a unit testing 
  framework for C.  We have already written several (17) test cases 
  for you.  Using these examples, implement your test cases using cmocka
  for your two functions.  You should have at least 3 test cases for
  each function for a total of 23 test cases.

  The starter file should be sufficient to demonstrate how to use
  cmocka, but the full documentation can be found here: \url{https://api.cmocka.org/}.
  A \mintinline{text}{makefile} has also been provided to help
  you easily compile your files.  Note that cmocka is already 
  installed on the CSE server.  If you compile on your own machine, you will
  have to install and troubleshoot cmocka yourself.  
  \item Turn in all of your files via webhandin, making sure that 
  it runs and executes correctly in the webgrader.  Each individual 
  student will need to hand in their own copy and will receive 
  their own individual grade.
\end{itemize}
