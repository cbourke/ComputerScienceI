\section*{Problem Statement}

In this hack you'll get some more practice writing functions that utilize 
pass-by-reference (pointers), error handling and enumerated types.  There 
are several different
ways to model colors including RGB and CMYK.  RGB is generally used in displays
and models a color with three values in the range $[0, 255]$ corresponding to 
the red, green and blue ``contribution'' to the color.  For example, the
triple $(255, 255, 0)$ corresponds to a full red and green (additive) value
which results in yellow.  CMYK or Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black is a model used
in printing where four colors of ink are combined to make various colors.
In this system, the four values are on the scale $[0, 1]$.  Write several
functions to convert between these models as well as converting an RGB
color to a \emph{grayscale} value.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a function to convert from an RGB color model to CMYK.  To 
convert to CMYK, you first need to scale each integer value to the range 
$[0, 1]$ by simply computing
	$$r' = \frac{r}{255}, \quad g' = \frac{g}{255}, \quad b' = \frac{b}{255}$$
	and then using the following formulas:
\begin{align*}
k & = 1-\max\{r', g', b'\} \\
c & = \frac{(1-r'-k)}{(1-k)} \\
m & = \frac{(1-g'-k)}{(1-k)} \\
y & = \frac{(1-b'-k)}{(1-k)} \\
\end{align*}
Your function should have the following signature:

\mintinline{c}{int rgbToCMYK(int r, int g, int b, double *c, double *m, double *y, double *k)}

Identify any and all error conditions and use the return value to indicate
an error code (0 for no error, non-zero value(s) for error conditions).

\item Write a function to convert from CMYK to RGB using the following formulas.
\begin{align*}
r & = 255 \cdot (1 - c) \cdot (1-k) \\
g & = 255 \cdot (1 - m) \cdot (1-k) \\
b & = 255 \cdot (1 - y) \cdot (1-k) \\
\end{align*}
Your function should have the following signature:

\mintinline{c}{int cmykToRGB(double c, double m, double y, double k, int *r, int *g, int *b)}

Identify any and all error conditions and use the return value to indicate
an error code (0 for no error, non-zero value(s) for error conditions).

\end{enumerate}



\section*{Instructions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item You are encouraged to collaborate any number of students 
  before, during, and after your scheduled hack session.  
  \item Design at least 3 test cases for each function
  \emph{before} you begin
  designing or implementing your program.  Test cases are 
  input-output pairs that are known to be correct using means
  other than your program.
  \item You may (in fact are encouraged) to define any additional
  ``helper'' functions that you find useful.
  \item Include the name(s) of everyone who worked together on
  this activity in your source file's header.
  \item Place your prototypes and documentation in a header file 
  named \mintinline{text}{colorUtils.h} and your source in a file
  named \mintinline{text}{colorUtils.c}.
  
  \item A testing file, \mintinline{text}{utilsTester.c} has been 
  provided that uses cmocka (\url{https://cmocka.org/}), a unit testing 
  framework for C.  We have already written several test cases 
  for the \mintinline{c}{rgbToCMYK} function that tests all error 
  conditions as well as a variety of inputs.
  
  Using these examples, implement similar test functions and 
  tests for the {cmykToRGB} function.  You should write enough
  tests cases to test for all error conditions as well as at least
  3 valid input/output examples.

  The starter file should be sufficient to demonstrate how to use
  cmocka, but the full documentation can be found here: \url{https://api.cmocka.org/}.
  A \mintinline{text}{makefile} has also been provided to help
  you easily compile your files.  Note that cmocka is already 
  installed on the CSE server.  If you compile on your own machine, you will
  have to install and troubleshoot cmocka yourself.  
  \item Turn in all of your files via webhandin, making sure that 
  it runs and executes correctly in the webgrader.  Each individual 
  student will need to hand in their own copy and will receive 
  their own individual grade.
