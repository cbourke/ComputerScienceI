# Introduction

Hack session activities are small weekly programming assignments
intended to get you started on full programming assignments. You may
complete the hack on your own, but you are *highly encouraged* to work
with another student and form a hack pair. Groups larger than 2 are not
allowed. However, you may discuss the problems *at a high level* with
other students or groups. You may not share code directly outside your
pair.

If you choose to form a Hack Pair, you *must*:

1.  Both join a hack pair on Canvas (go to People then Groups)

2.  You must both work on the hack equally; it must be an equal effort
    by both partners. Do not undermine your partner's learning
    opportunity and do not undermine your own by allowing one parter to
    do all the work.

3.  You may both turn in a copy, but only one will be graded (generally
    the one whose last name comes first alphabetically).

## Rubric

You are graded based on style, documentation, design and correctness.
For detail, see the general course rubric.

| Category      | Points |
|---------------|--------|
| Style         | 2      |
| Documentation | 2      |
| Design        | 5      |
| Correctness   | 16     |
| Total         | 25     |

For correctness:
 - Your program(s) *must* compile and run on the grader
 - Points are awarded proportionally for each test case.

# Problem Statement

A binomial coefficient, " $n$ choose $k$ " is a number that corresponds to
the number of ways to *choose* $k$ items from a set of $n$ distinct
items. You may be familiar with some the notations, $C(n,k)$ or $C_n^k$
or ${}_{n}C_k$, but most commonly this is written as ${n \choose k}$
and read as "$n$ choose $k$". There is an easy to compute formula
involving factorials:

$${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$$

For example, if we have $n = 4$ items, say $\{a, b, c, d\}$ and want to
choose $k=2$ of them, then there are

$${4 \choose 2} = \frac{4!}{(4-2)!2!} = 6$$

ways of doing this. The six ways are:

{a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {b, c}, {b, d}, {c, d}

There are a lot of other interpretations and applications for binomial
coefficients, but this hack will focus on computing their value using a
different formula, Pascal's Rule:

$${n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k} + {n-1 \choose k-1}$$

which is a recursive formula. The base cases for Pascal's Rule are when $k = 0$ and
$n = k$. In both cases, the value is 1. When $k = 0$, we are not
choosing any elements and so there is only one way of doing that
(i.e.Â choose nothing). When $n = k$ we are choosing every element, again
there is only one way of doing that.

## Writing a Naive Recursion

Implement and test the following function *using a recursive* solution:

`long choose(int n, int k);`

which takes $n$ and $k$ and computes ${n\choose k}$ using Pascal's Rule.
Note that the return type is a `long` which is a 64-bit integer
allowing you to compute values up to

$$2^{63}-1 = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807$$

(a little over 9 quintillion). Write a `main` function that takes $n$
and $k$ as command line arguments and outputs the result to the standard
output so you can easily test it.

## Benchmarking

Run your program on values of $n, k$ in the following table and time
(roughly) how long it takes your program to execute. You can check
your solutions with an online tool such as <https://www.wolframalpha.com/>.

| $n$ | $k$ |
|-----|-----|
| 4   | 2   |
| 10  | 5   |
| 32  | 16  |
| 34  | 17  |
| 36  | 18  |

Now formulate an estimate of how long your program would take to execute
with larger values. You can make a *rough* estimate how many function
calls are made using the binomial value itself. To compute
${n \choose k}$ using Pascal's Rule would make *about* ${n \choose k}$
function calls.

Use the running time of your program from the test values to estimate
how long your program would run for the values in the following
table.

  | ${n \choose k}$   |                       value   |
  |-------------------|-------------------------------|
  | ${54 \choose 27}$ |       = 1,946,939,425,648,112 |
  | ${56 \choose 28}$ |       = 7,648,690,600,760,440 |
  | ${58 \choose 29}$ |      = 30,067,266,499,541,040 |
  | ${60 \choose 30}$ |     = 118,264,581,564,861,424 |
  | ${62 \choose 31}$ |     = 465,428,353,255,261,088 |
  | ${64 \choose 32}$ |   = 1,832,624,140,942,590,534 |
  | ${66 \choose 33}$ |   = 7,219,428,434,016,265,740 |


## Improving Performance with Memoization

You'll now improve your program's performance using memoization (caching)
to avoid unnecessary repeated recursive calls.

1.  Write code (either in the `main` function or using another
    "entry point" function) to create a memoization table containing
    `long` values of dimension $(n+1) \times (k+1)$

2.  Initialize the values in the table to $-1$ as a flag value to
    indicate that the value in the table has not yet been set.

3.  Using your previous recursive implementation as a guide, write a new
    recursive function that also takes the table as a parameter. When
    the function needs to compute ${n \choose k}$ it checks the table
    first: if the value has already been computed (is not $-1$) then it
    returns that value. Otherwise, it performs the recursive
    computation. Before returning the value, however, it should store it
    (*cache* it) in the table so that subsequent computations avoid the
    recursion.

4.  Modify your `main` function to use this more efficient version
    and re-test it with the values above. Compare the time it took using
    memoization versus the naive recursion.

5.  Rerun your program with the values in the tables above to verify
    they work and observe the difference in running time.

# Instructions

-   Place all of your function definitions in a source file named
    `binomial.c` and hand it in with your header file,
    `binomial.h`. Place your `main` function in a file named
    `binomialDemo.c`
