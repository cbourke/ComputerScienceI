> "If you really want to understand something, the best way is to try
> and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your
> own mind... that's really the essence of programming. By the time
> you've sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a
> stupid machine can deal with, you've certainly learned something about
> it yourself."
>
> —Douglas Adams, *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency*

> In my experience, you assert control over a computer–show it who's the
> boss–by making it do something unique. That means programming it... If
> you devote a couple of hours to programming a new machine, you'll feel
> better about it ever afterwards"
>
> —Michael Crichton, Electronic Life

> The readings were the most underrated things ever (I've never actually
> read them but I wish I did) thanks for providing them and leaving the
> whole course available to us.

## University Policies, Resources & Services

Students are responsible for knowing the university policies and
be aware of resources found on this page: https://go.unl.edu/coursepolicies

### Continuation of Instruction

If in-person classes are canceled by the University during a lecture
day, lecture may still be livestreamed.  If in-person classes are canceled
by the University during a lab/hack day, in-person attendance will not be
required, help *may* be made available via zoom and you will still be
expected to complete the work remotely.

## Skills Objectives

This course has several learning objectives and "skills objectives."
These are the skills that, upon successful completion of this course,
you should be able to exhibit.

-   You should have a mastery of the fundamentals of programming in a
    high-level language, including data types and rudimentary data
    structures, control flow, repetition, selection, input/output, and
    procedures and functions.

-   You should be able to approach a reasonably complex problem, design
    a top-down solution, and code a program in a high-level programming
    language that automates solutions.

-   You should have a familiarity with problem solving methods,
    including problem analysis, requirements and specifications, design,
    decomposition and step-wise refinement, and algorithm development
    (including recursion).

-   You should have a familiarity with software development principles
    and practices, including data and operation abstraction,
    encapsulation, modularity, code and artifact reuse, prototyping,
    iterative development, best practices in coding design, style, and
    documentation, a good understanding of proper testing and debugging
    techniques and a familiarity with development tools.

-   You should have exposure to algorithms for searching, sorting and
    other problems, graphical user interfaces, event-driven programming,
    and database access.

-   You should have a foundation for further software development and
    exploration. You should have a deep enough understanding of at least
    one high-level programming language that you should be able to learn
    another programming language with relative ease in a relatively
    short amount of time.

## Schedule

See the course website (canvas).

## Grading

Assessment (grading) will be based on weekly readings, labs,
"hacks", attendance as well as exams and a comprehensive final
with the following point distributions.

|  Category           | Number | Points Each | Total |
|  -------------------|--------|-------------|-------|
|  Starter Points     |        |             |     20|
|  PDC Module/Surveys |        |             |     50|
|  Readings (zyBooks) |      13|           15|    195|
|  Labs               |      12|           15|    180|
|  Hacks              |      13|           25|    325|
|  Attendace          |      13|           10|    130|
|  Exams              |       2|           75|    150|
|  Final              |       1|          150|    150|
|  Total              |        |             |  1,200|


### Starter Points

It is important to start out positively. Put yourself in the mindset
that you *will* succeed in this course and commit yourself to putting in
a full effort in every aspect of it. To get you started, we're giving
you **free starter points**. You have a perfect score in this course
already!  Keep it up!

### PDC Modules/Surveys

This course is experimenting with introducing **Parallel and Distributed
Computing** (PDC) concepts early in the computing curriculum.  These
topics are usually covered in depth in advanced elective courses.
However, we have developed a series of "codeless" modules that do not
require any coding knowledge and cover PDC concepts in an accessible
manner.  

As part of this experiment, you will complete a pre-module survey which
will be graded based on completion (25 points).  You will then go
through 3 modules on PDC which includes running and observing some
simulations, visualizations, etc.  You may complete these modules
at your own pace.  Once completed, you will then take a post-module
survey (25 points) again graded based on completion only.  Full
details and due dates are posted in canvas.  

### Readings

This course is organized into modules (roughly 1 module per week) and
each module has reading associated with it. Some reading is required and
other readings are suggested/recommended and provide a deeper
understanding of the topics. Some of the required reading will be
assessed and will count toward your grade.

The assessed reading for this course is delivered through an online
textbook provided by zyBooks, a
web-based interactive text book that has you do some reading and then
assesses your understanding through short quiz questions. You may retry
these quizzes until you get them correct. These readings are assessed
based on completion and are generally due *before* the lectures on the
modules in order to better prepare you for the presented material. If
you do not complete the readings for each module, you will not receive
any credit.

Not every set of required reading represents an equal amount of work.
Some modules have more reading than others. However, all assessment is
equally weighted since it is based on completion.  

### Labs

There will be weekly labs that give you hands-on exercises for topics
recently covered in lecture. The purpose of lab is not only to give you
further working experience with lecture topics, but also to provide you
with additional information and details not necessarily covered in
lecture. Each lab will have some programming requirements and a
supplemental worksheet.

Depending on logistics, those in the on-campus section may be randomly
paired with a partner. One of you will be the *driver* and the other
will be the *navigator*. The navigator will be responsible for reading
the instructions and guiding the driver. The driver will be in charge of
the keyboard and will type the code. Both driver and navigator are
responsible for developing and working through solutions together.
Neither the navigator nor the driver is "in charge," it is an equal
partnership. Beyond your immediate pairing, you are encouraged to help
and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

For those in the online section or those attending remotely, you may
work alone or we may partner you with someone in a zoom breakout room.

Each lab is assessed based on completion. In general you will need to
submit code and (possibly) an electronic writeup of your worksheet
through an online grading system.  You will
have until midnight on the day of the lab (Tuesdays) to submit your
solutions. Points will be awarded based on the results of the online
grader.

### Hacks

There will be weekly Thursday *hack sessions* that will provide an
opportunity to start working on exercises in an open, collaborative
environment. Each hack session is a simple program or exercise. You may
not necessarily complete the entire exercise during the hack session.

Further details are provided in the handouts, but you are highly
encouraged to collaborate with any individual and to receive as much
help as you desire on the exercises.

You may complete hacks on your own, but you are encouraged to
pair up and collaborate with (**at most**) one other student.
If you choose to pair up with another student, you must form
a pair using canvas (People -> Hack Pairs).

### Attendance

To ensure participation your attendance **and** engagement in your
weekly lab/hack sessions will be graded.  Each session will be worth 10
points.  To earn the full 10 points you must:

  * Attend **both** the lab and hack session for the entire time.  Do
    not be more than 5 minutes late.
  * Put forth a full effort.  You must work on the lab/hack for that
    week or for other material in the course; you may not work on
    other material or remain idle.
  * You may only leave the lab/hack session early if you have already
    completed both the lab and hack for that module.

**Alternative**

It is understandable that you may not be able to attend every lab/hack
session or that your background or approach to this material means you
don't need the structured environment that the lab/hack session provides.
As an alternative, *if you can prove yourself capable* of completing
labs and hacks on your own you may choose not to attend the lab/hack session.

If you attend as outlined above, you get the full 10 points.  If you
choose not to attend, you may still earn the 10 points ***provided***
that you earn at least 75% of the remaining points for each module
(Reading/Lab/Hack).  If you do not attend and you earn less than 75% of
the points for the module, you will get a zero for the attendance portion
of the module.

### Exams

There will be several exams as well as a comprehensive
final exam. These will be open-book, open-note, *required computer* exams.
The exams consist of live coding exercises for which you will need your own
machine as you will be coding and submitting programs online for
grading. More details will be announced closer to the exam dates.
No collaboration is allowed on exams.

### 15th Week Policy Notification

A per UNL's 15th Week Policy (also known as "dead week") available here:

<https://registrar.unl.edu/academic-standards/policies/fifteenth-week-policy/>

we are required to serve written notice that the final assignment as
well as the final lab, hack, and assignment will be due during the 15th
week.

### Scale

Final letter grades will be awarded based on the following standard
scale. This scale may be adjusted upwards if the instructor deems it
necessary based on the final grades only. No scale may be made for
individual assignments or exams.

| Letter Grade | Percent |
|--------------|---------|
| A+           | >= 97%  |
| A            | >= 93%  |
| A-           | >= 90%  |
| B+           | >= 87%  |
| B            | >= 83%  |
| B-           | >= 80%  |
| C+           | >= 77%  |
| C            | >= 73%  |
| C-           | >= 70%  |
| D+           | >= 67%  |
| D            | >= 63%  |
| D-           | >= 60%  |
| F            | < 60%   |

### Grading Policy

If you have questions about grading or believe that points were deducted
unfairly, you must first address the issue with the individual who
graded it to see if it can be resolved. Such questions should be made
within a reasonable amount of time after the graded assignment has been
returned. No further consideration will be given to any assignment a
week after it grades have been posted. It is important to emphasize that
the goal of grading is consistency. A grade on any given assignment,
even if it is low for the entire class, should not matter that much.
Rather, students who do comparable work should receive comparable grades
(see the subsection on the scale used for this course).

### Late Work Policy

In general, there will be no make-up exams or late work accepted.
Exceptions may be made in certain circumstances such as health or
emergency, but you must make every effort to get prior permission.
Documentation may also be required.

Assignments have a strict due date/time as defined in canvas and the
online handin system. All program files must be handed in as
specified in individual assignment instructions. Programs that
are even a few seconds past the due date/time will be considered late
and you will be locked out of handing anything in after that time.

### Webgrader Policy

Failure to adhere to the requirements of an assignment in such a manner
that makes it impossible to grade your program means that a
disproportionate amount of time would be spent evaluating your
assignment. For this reason, we will not grade any assignment
that does not compile and run through the online grading system.

## Academic Integrity

All homework assignments, programs, and exams must represent your own
work unless otherwise stated. No collaboration with fellow students,
past or current, is allowed unless otherwise permitted on specific
assignments or problems. The Department of Computer Science &
Engineering has an Academic Integrity Policy. All students enrolled in
any computer science course are bound by this policy. You are expected
to read, understand, and follow this policy. Violations will be dealt
with on a case by case basis and may result in a failing assignment or a
failing grade for the course itself. The most recent version of the
Academic Integrity Policy can be found at
<https://computing.unl.edu/academic-integrity-policy>

### Artificial Intelligence Tool Usage

Various Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have been developed
in recent years (technically called Large Language Models) that can
generate code based on user interactions.  The use of these
tools (including but not limited to ChatGPT, GitHub's co-pilot, etc.)
in *any* capacity for this course is ***strictly prohibited*** and any such
use will be considered a violation of academic integrity.  Violations
may include zeros on assignments or failure of the course.

These tools have legitimate uses, but not for students in this course.
You are here to learn the basics of problem solving, programming and
computing.  These tools simply give you answers without you having to
think, learn or understand the solution(s) that they give you.  Often
these tools will give you answers that violate academic integrity even
if you do not explicitly ask them to do so.  It would *clearly* be
a violation of academic integrity if you asked another *human* to write
a program for you and they did so.  Asking an AI to do so is no different.
You will not build muscle by having someone else lift weights for you.
You will not learn anything by having someone else, human or AI, do the
learning for you.  

That said, these tools *can* provide a meaningful learning experience if
they are properly filtered.  For that reason, we have enabled (and paid
for) access to a *version* of ChatGPT that you *are allowed* to use.
This version has been designed to *not* provide substantial code or
*too much* help that would violate academic integrity.  The application
is called CodeHelp and is available at <https://codehelp.app/>.  Your
instructor will provide a (free) sign up link.

## Communication & Getting Help

The primary means of communication for this course is an online message
forum system designed for college courses. You should have received an
invitation to join. If you have not, contact the instructor immediately.
On this forum, you can ask questions anonymously, remain anonymous to your classmates,
or choose to be identified. Using this open forum system the entire
class benefits from the instructor and TA responses. In addition, you
and other students can also answer each other's questions (again you may
choose to remain anonymous or identify yourself to the instructors or
everyone). You may still email the instructor or TAs, but more than
likely you will be redirected to this message board for help.

In addition, there are two anonymous suggestion boxes that you may use
to voice your concerns about any problems in the course if you do not
wish to be identified. My personal box is available on the course
webpage. The department also maintains an anonymous suggestion box
available at <https://computing.unl.edu/anonymous-department-feedback-form>.

### Learning Assistant Program (LAP)

This course is supported by the CSE Learning Assistant Program (LAP).  
The mission of the LAP is to improve student comprehension and
retention in computing fields by focusing on the learner's experience.
This course will be supplemented by Learning Assistants (LAs) and Course
Leaders (CLs) to help improve your learning. LAs and CLs are other
undergraduate students who have taken the same or similar courses
and have been trained to help you succeed in this course. Your LAs
and CLs will hold regular office hours, help with grading, and assist
you with labs/assignments.

I strongly encourage you to utilize the LAs and CLs when you are
completing coursework. More information can be found in the Learning
Assistant Program Module on Canvas.

### Getting Help

Your success in this course is ultimately your responsibility. Your
success in this course depends on how well you utilize the opportunities
and resources that we provide. There are numerous outlets for learning
the material and getting help in this course:

-   Lectures: attend lectures regularly and when you do use the time
    appropriately. Do not distract yourself with social media or other
    time wasters. Actively take notes (electronic or hand written). It
    is well-documented that good note taking directly leads to
    understanding and retention of concepts.

-   Lecture Videos: Lecture videos are intended as a supplement that
    mirrors lecture material but that may not cover everything. Watch
    them at your own pace on a regular basis for reiteration or in case
    you missed something in lecture.

-   Required Reading: do the required reading on a regular basis. The
    readings provide additional details and depth that you may not
    necessarily get directly in lecture.

-   Labs & Hack Sessions: use your time during lab and hack sessions
    wisely. Engage with your lab instructors, teaching assistants, your
    partner(s) and other students. Be sure to adequately prepare for
    labs by reading the handouts before coming to lab. Get started and
    don't get distracted.

-   Online message board: if you have questions post to our online
    message board. It is the best and
    likely fastest way to get help with your questions. Also, be sure to
    read other student's posts and questions and feel free to answer
    yourself!

-   Office Hours & Student Resource Center: the instructor and teaching
    assistants hold regular office hours throughout the week as posted
    on the course website. Attend office hours if you have questions or
    want to review material. The Student Resource Center (SRC,
    <https://computing.unl.edu/current-undergraduate#SRC>)
    Monday through Friday. Even if your TAs
    are not scheduled during that time, there are plenty of other TAs
    and students present that may be able to help. And, you may be able
    to help others!

-   Don't procrastinate. The biggest reason students fail this course is
    because they do not give themselves enough opportunities to learn
    the material. Don't wait to the last minute to start your
    assignments. Many people wait to the last minute and flood the TAs
    and SRC, making it difficult to get help as the due date approaches.
    Don't underestimate how much time your assignment(s) will take and
    don't wait to the week before hand to get started. Ideally, you
    should be working on the problems as we are covering them.

-   Get help in the *right way*: when you go to the instructor or TA for
    help, you must demonstrate that you have put forth a good faith
    effort toward understanding the material. Asking questions that
    clearly indicate you have failed to read the required material, have
    not been attending lecture, etc. is *not acceptable*. Don't ask
    generic questions like "I'm lost, I don't know what I'm doing".
    Instead, explain what you have tried so far. Explain why you think
    what you have tried doesn't seem to be working. Then the TA will
    have an easier time to help you identify misconceptions or problems.
    This is known as "Rubber Duck Debugging" where in if you try to
    explain a problem to someone (or, lacking a live person, a rubber
    duck), then you can usually identify the problem yourself. Or, at
    the very least, get some insight as to what might be wrong.
