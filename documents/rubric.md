These are the rubric guidelines for the course.  In general, code
is assessed based on 4 general categories: Style, Documentation,
Design, and Correctness.  In addition, for your submission to be
considered, you need to ensure that:

* All required artifacts (code, header files, etc.) are handed in
  via the electronic handin system
* All file names are correct
* All files compile and execute

# Categories

The four categories include but are not limited to the following items.

## Style

* Appropriate variable and function/method identifiers
* Style and naming conventions are consistent
* Good use of whitespace; proper indentation
* Clean, readable code
* Code is well-organized

## Documentation

* Well written comments that clearly explain the purpose of each non-trivial piece of code
* Comments explain the "what" and "why"
* Comments are not overly verbose or overly terse
* Code itself is "self-documenting"; it explains the "how"

## Program Design

* Code is well-organized and efficient
* Code is modular; substantial pieces of it could be reused; few redundancies
* Code is easily understood and maintainable
* It is clear that sufficient testing has been performed
* Corner cases and bad input have been anticipated and appropriate error handling has been implemented  

## Program Correctness

* Source code compiles and executes as expected
* Program runs as specified: correctly reads any input; correctly formatted output
* Test cases successfully execute

# Hack Points

Each hack is worth 25 points distributed as follows.

| Category      | Points |
|---------------|--------|
| Style         | 2      |
| Documentation | 2      |
| Design        | 5      |
| Correctness   | 16     |
| Total         | 25     |

Specific point deductions guidelines follow.  Each of these
items will result in a point deduction.

## Style

* Significant improper or inconsistent use of whitespace
* Significant improper identifier naming or inconsistent naming conventions

## Documentation

* Missing author (name, date, program purpose) header documentation
* Substantial blocks (functions, complex code) are not properly documented
* Overly verbose or useless comments

## Design

* Compiler warnings have not been addressed
* Dead or extraneous code remains
* Insufficient error handling regardless of grader behavior/output
* Extraneous or unnecessary output (debugging or error statements)
* Redundant code
* Improper or incorrect patterns, variable types, etc.
* Contains obvious memory leaks or misuse of data types          

## Correctness

* Output is not reasonably readable
* Output does not report as much information as expected

In addition, the remaining points for correctness are awarded
proportionally for how many test case(s) pass.
