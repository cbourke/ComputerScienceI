# Screen Captures

If you need to take a "photo" of something on a screen, don't take it with your
phone.  It is terrible quality and ends up being *more* work (transferring it).
Instead, take a screenshot of your computer.

# Zip Files

A "zip" file is a compressed archive file.  It allows users to bundle
multiple folders and/or files into a single file and compress them so
that they take up less memory for easier storage and transfer.
